FontMagic Next-run candidates
============================

1) Add a tiny in-UI debug pane (hidden behind a slash command) to show resolved CVar/console names per client for faster support triage.
2) Audit and normalize tooltip wording/tone across all controls for consistent help text style.
3) Add a non-invasive UI pass for keyboard/gamepad focus order in the main panel and combat options panel.
4) Add targeted helper wrappers for GameTooltip usage to centralize nil-safety and reduce repeated guards.
5) Evaluate a lightweight frame-pool pattern for dropdown hover preview decorations to further reduce recycled-button edge cases.
