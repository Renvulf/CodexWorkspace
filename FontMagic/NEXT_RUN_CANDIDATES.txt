1) Add a compact "pending changes" status line in the main panel so users can immediately tell preview-only vs applied state.
2) Consolidate dropdown row construction into one helper (favorites + normal groups) to reduce duplicate logic and future drift.
3) Add a small compatibility wrapper for Settings category registration failures with a one-time chat warning fallback.
4) Audit/reset duplicate candidate file names (`Next-run-candidates.txt` vs `NEXT_RUN_CANDIDATES.txt`) to keep repo metadata tidy.
5) Add a guarded refresh button for motion/scale bounds in case command metadata arrives after login on some clients.
6) Tighten minimap drag clamping at very low/high UI scale factors to avoid edge clipping.
