FontMagic next-run candidates (prioritized)

1) Add a tiny in-panel 'data refreshed' timestamp/indicator for combat CVars to make pending-vs-live state even clearer.
2) Consolidate repeated dropdown selection code paths into one helper to reduce maintenance risk.
3) Add optional out-of-combat deferred apply queue messaging for any future protected-frame interactions.
4) Audit and normalize tooltip phrasing/punctuation for all controls for fully consistent microcopy.
5) Evaluate safe one-time layout constants pass for combat subpanel vertical rhythm on very low UI scales.
6) Add lightweight debug toggle (dev-only) to print resolved console/CVar mappings for troubleshooting client deltas.
