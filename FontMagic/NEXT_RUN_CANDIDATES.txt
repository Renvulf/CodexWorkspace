1) Add a compact read-only custom-font availability summary (loaded/missing count) in the Custom category tooltip.
2) Add a lightweight self-check command that validates favorite keys and reports stale entries without mutating data.
3) Add keyboard-friendly tooltip hints for dropdown focus navigation (Tab/Shift+Tab, Enter) when the window first opens.
4) Add an optional import/export string for favorites only (no combat settings) with strict validation.
