1) Add a lightweight self-check command that validates favorite keys and reports stale entries without mutating data.
2) Add keyboard-friendly tooltip hints for dropdown focus navigation (Tab/Shift+Tab, Enter) when the window first opens.
3) Add an optional import/export string for favorites only (no combat settings) with strict validation.
4) Add a small in-panel note that explains why custom font slots can show as missing when files are misnamed/corrupt.
