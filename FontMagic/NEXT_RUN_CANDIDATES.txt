1) Add a small "Apply" pulse/highlight when a preview is pending, then clear it immediately after apply/reset.
2) Consolidate repeated preview refresh snippets into one helper to reduce drift across dropdown/select/reset paths.
3) Add an out-of-combat, user-triggered "Re-read slider bounds" action for clients where console metadata arrives late.
4) Normalize duplicate metadata filename casing (`Next-run-candidates.txt` vs `NEXT_RUN_CANDIDATES.txt`) after confirming external tooling expectations.
5) Add one lightweight self-check command that prints resolved combat-text CVars for support/debug reports.
