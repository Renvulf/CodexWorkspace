1) Evaluate a two-column reflow for the expanded combat options panel to reduce scroll depth at 1080p.
2) Consider a compact mode preset for low UI scale users without changing current defaults.
3) Add optional keyboard navigation between dropdown groups in the main panel (arrow/Tab shortcuts) if it can be done without taint risk.
4) Audit combat-panel control tooltips for API-unavailable states and standardize disabled-state help text wording.
5) Add a tiny inline hint near minimap radius command text in /float help output to improve discoverability.
