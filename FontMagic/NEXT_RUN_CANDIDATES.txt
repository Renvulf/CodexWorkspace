2) Audit and normalize tooltip wording/tone across all controls for consistent help text style.
3) Add targeted helper wrappers for GameTooltip usage to centralize nil-safety and reduce repeated guards.
4) Evaluate a lightweight frame-pool pattern for dropdown hover preview decorations to further reduce recycled-button edge cases.
