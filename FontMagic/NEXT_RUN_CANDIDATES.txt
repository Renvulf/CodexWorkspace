1) Add an explicit "Applied vs Previewing" badge in dropdown labels for clearer pending-state visibility.
2) Add optional per-character recent preview history persistence (with account-wide fallback).
3) Add a compact read-only custom-font availability summary (loaded/missing count) in the Custom category tooltip.
4) Add a lightweight self-check command that validates favorite keys and reports stale entries without mutating data.
