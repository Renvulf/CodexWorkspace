1) Add a lightweight "last refresh result details" tooltip for metadata refresh failures (client API gaps).
2) Add a quick in-panel diagnostics copy button for resolved combat setting targets to simplify support reports.
3) Add an explicit "Applied vs Previewing" badge in dropdown labels for clearer pending-state visibility.
4) Add optional per-character recent preview history persistence (with account-wide fallback).
