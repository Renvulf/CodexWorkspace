1) Keyboard focus traversal polish for the combat options panel (tab order + focus handling for preview/edit controls).
2) Add an explicit non-backdrop visual fallback style for clients/templates where SetBackdrop is unavailable.
3) Validate minimap icon drag UX with very small minimap scales and clamp hit-region if accidental drags are reported.
4) Evaluate a two-column reflow for the expanded combat options panel to reduce scroll depth at 1080p.
5) Consider a compact mode preset for low UI scale users without changing current defaults.
