1) Add optional per-character recent preview history persistence (with account-wide fallback).
2) Add a compact read-only custom-font availability summary (loaded/missing count) in the Custom category tooltip.
3) Add a lightweight self-check command that validates favorite keys and reports stale entries without mutating data.
4) Add keyboard-friendly tooltip hints for dropdown focus navigation (Tab/Shift+Tab, Enter) when the window first opens.
