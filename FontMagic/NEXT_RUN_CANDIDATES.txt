1) Add keyboard focus traversal polish for the combat options panel (tab order + clear focus ring behavior).
2) Evaluate a two-column reflow for the expanded combat options panel to reduce scroll depth on 1080p.
3) Validate minimap icon drag UX with very small minimap scales and clamp hit-region if accidental drags are reported.
4) Consider a compact mode preset for low UI scale users without changing current defaults.
