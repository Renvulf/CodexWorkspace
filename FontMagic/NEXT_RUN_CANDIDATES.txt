1) Validate minimap icon behavior on ultra-wide + square minimap add-ons and add a bounded radius option if overlap is observed.
2) Add keyboard focus traversal polish for the combat options panel (tab order + clear focus ring behavior).
3) Evaluate a two-column reflow for the expanded combat options panel to reduce scroll depth on 1080p.
4) Add a lightweight diagnostics export command for resolved combat setting targets (copy-friendly chat output).
5) Consider a compact mode preset for low UI scale users without changing current defaults.
