1) Add a tiny in-panel status line that explains when combat text writes are deferred due to combat lockdown (if any setter ever becomes protected on a future client).
2) Consolidate repeated "Select Font" label resets into one helper to reduce dropdown-state drift risk.
3) Add a lightweight debug slash command (off by default) to print resolved CVar/console targets for support diagnostics.
4) Normalize tooltip phrasing/capitalization across all combat options for tighter UX consistency.
5) Add a guarded refresh hook so motion sliders auto-refresh bounds when Blizzard settings metadata hot-reloads after login.
6) Review minimap button drag clamping at non-1.0 UI scale for edge clipping polish.
