1) Normalize duplicate metadata filename casing (`Next-run-candidates.txt` vs `NEXT_RUN_CANDIDATES.txt`) after confirming external tooling expectations.
2) Add one lightweight self-check command that prints resolved combat-text CVars for support/debug reports.
3) Audit and normalize tooltip wording/tone across all controls for consistent help text style.
4) Add targeted helper wrappers for GameTooltip usage to centralize nil-safety and reduce repeated guards.
5) Evaluate a lightweight frame-pool pattern for dropdown hover preview decorations to further reduce recycled-button edge cases.
