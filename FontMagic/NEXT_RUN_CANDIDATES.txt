1) Standardize disabled-state tooltip wording across combat panel controls when APIs are unavailable.
2) Add lightweight API-availability badges to combat controls for faster troubleshooting.
3) Evaluate optional debounce for combat-metadata refresh button to avoid accidental rapid rebuilds.
4) Add an in-panel one-click /reload helper after layout preset changes.
5) Add a compact "recently previewed fonts" strip to speed side-by-side comparisons.
