1) Add a tiny in-panel status line for deferred writes when in combat lockdown (future-proof if any related setter becomes protected).
2) Centralize repeated "Select Font" dropdown label resets into one helper to reduce state-drift risk.
3) Normalize tooltip phrasing/capitalization across combat options for tighter UX consistency.
4) Add a guarded metadata refresh hook so motion/scale slider bounds can refresh after late client command table updates.
5) Review minimap icon drag clamping at non-1.0 UI scales to avoid edge clipping.
6) Add an optional debug slash output (off by default) for resolved CVar/console targets used by this client.
